# Breast_Cancer_Survival_Prediction
## **Description:**
* **Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. It is the most common cancer in women, after skin cancer. Breast cancer can occur in men, but it is much less common.**
* **Breast cancer starts when cells in the breast grow out of control. These cells form a tumor. The tumor can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors are not cancerous. Malignant tumors are cancerous.**
* **Malignant breast tumors can spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones, liver, and lungs. This is called metastasis.**


## Datasets:
* **We have a dataset of over 400 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery for the treatment of breast cancer. Below is the information of all columns in the dataset:**

* **Patient_ID:** ID of the patient
* **Age:** Age of the patient
* **Gender:** Gender of the patient
Protein1, Protein2, Protein3, Protein4: expression levels
* **Tumor_Stage**: Breast cancer stage of the patient
* **Histology:** Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, Infiltration Lobular Carcinoma, Mucinous Carcinoma
* **ER status:** Positive/Negative
* **PR status:** Positive/Negative
* **HER2 status:** Positive/Negative
* **Surgery_type:** Lumpectomy, Simple Mastectomy, Modified Radical Mastectomy, Other
* **DateofSurgery:** The date of Surgery
* **DateofLast_Visit:** The date of the last visit of the patient
* **Patient_Status:** Alive/Dead


## Sort Summary Of Datasets

* **Age:** The patient's age at diagnosis is an important risk factor for breast and ovarian cancer. The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age, and the risk of developing ovarian cancer increases even more with age.
* **Gender:** Women are more likely to develop breast and ovarian cancer than men. This is because women have two copies of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, while men only have one copy.
* **Race:** African American women are more likely to develop breast cancer than white women. This is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
* **Ethnicity:** Hispanic women are more likely to develop ovarian cancer than non-Hispanic white women. This is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
* **Family history:** Women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer are at an increased risk of developing the disease themselves. This is because they are more likely to inherit a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
* **Tumor size:** The size of the tumor at diagnosis is an important factor in predicting the patient's prognosis. Larger tumors are more likely to be aggressive and to spread to other parts of the body.
* **Tumor grade:** The grade of the tumor is a measure of how abnormal the cells look under a microscope. Higher-grade tumors are more likely to be aggressive and to spread to other parts of the body.
* **Stage:** The stage of the cancer at diagnosis is a measure of how far the cancer has spread. Early-stage cancers are more likely to be cured than late-stage cancers.
* **HER2 status:** The HER2 status of the tumor is a measure of whether the tumor cells have too much of the * **HER2 protein. HER2-positive tumors are more likely to be aggressive and to spread to other parts of the body.
* **Treatment:** The treatment that the patient receives will depend on the stage of the cancer, the tumor grade, and the HER2 status. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy.
* **Survival status:** Whether the patient is alive or dead is an important measure of the effectiveness of treatment. Patients with early-stage cancer who receive treatment have a good chance of survival. Patients with late-stage cancer who receive treatment may still have a chance of survival, but the chances are lower.
